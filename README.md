    ANF <--> VDB

### 🧠 Biggest Insights    API <--> REDIS

1. **Agent specialization matters** - Focused roles > generalists    API <--> DB

2. **Orchestration is complex** - Framework choice impacts everything    API <--> REACT

3. **Context management is hard** - Memory/state is critical    REACT <--> MONITOR

4. **Cost adds up fast** - Need smart caching and batching    MONITOR <--> VIZ

5. **Testing is challenging** - Non-deterministic behavior requires new strategies    DEPLOY <--> MONITOR_SYS
